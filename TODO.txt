- Relevant chunk searching optimization using heightmap
- Deleting completely irrelevant chunks on the fly.
- Saving progress inside of the world folder, so that if you close the script it will restore your progress and continue
- Command line arguments
- Test how long it takes to load each chunk into memory when the list is sorted vs. when it's not sorted (use large world!)
    - for creative world with sorted chunks: 612 s.
    - for creative world without sorted chunks: predicting 583 s. (seems random to me... need to retest like 10 times)
    - for creative world with region-sorted chunks:  630 s. (The fuck.)
- Iterator for chunks in radius (not including this chunk.)
